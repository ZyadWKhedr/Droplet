🌦️ Smart Environmental Monitoring System (ESP32 + Supabase)

This project is an IoT-based environmental monitoring system built with ESP32, designed to measure and record temperature, humidity, rain, and water level.
The collected data is displayed on an LCD screen, controlled via a keypad, and uploaded in real-time to a Supabase database over Wi-Fi.
It also includes an automatic servo control system based on rain and water-level conditions.

🚀 Features

🌡️ Reads temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor

💧 Monitors rain detection and water level

⚙️ Automatically controls a servo motor depending on the environment

📟 Interactive menu system via a 4x4 keypad and LCD display

☁️ Sends data to a Supabase database every 3 seconds

⏰ Synchronizes timestamps using NTP (Network Time Protocol)

📶 Connects to Wi-Fi and uploads readings in JSON format

🧰 Libraries Used

Make sure to install these libraries in the Arduino IDE:

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <DHT.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Keypad.h>
#include <ESP32Servo.h>
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <ESPSupabase.h>
#include "time.h"


You can install them from:

Library Manager (Arduino IDE → Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries)

Or from their GitHub repositories

⚙️ Configuration
🔑 Supabase Setup

Replace with your own credentials:

String supabase_url = "https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co";
String anon_key = "YOUR-ANON-KEY";
String table = "readings";

📶 Wi-Fi Setup

Enter your Wi-Fi credentials:

const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* psswd = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

🕹️ How It Works
1. Startup

Connects to Wi-Fi and initializes all sensors and LCD.

Synchronizes time using NTP.

2. Menu Navigation

Use the 4x4 keypad:

# → Next menu item

* → Previous menu item

D → Select

B → Back to menu

3. Display Options

You can view:

🌧️ Rain sensor status

🌡️ DHT11 temperature & humidity readings

💧 Water container level

⚙️ Servo motor state

4. Data Upload

Every 3 seconds, the ESP32 sends a JSON payload to Supabase:

{
  "time": "2025-10-16T21:45:00Z",
  "temperature": 28.5,
  "humidity": 61.3,
  "water_level": 1842,
  "rain_detected": true
}

5. Servo Control

The servo position changes automatically:

Closes when rain is detected or water tank is full

Opens when safe (no rain and low water level)

🧪 Example Output

Serial Monitor:

Connecting to WiFi....
Connected!
IP Address: 192.168.1.5
✅ Inserted into Supabase!


LCD Display:

DHT11 State

📈 Future Improvements

Add OLED or web dashboard visualization

Include more sensors (e.g., soil moisture, light intensity)

Add push notifications via Supabase functions or Telegram

Add calibration menu for sensor thresholds
